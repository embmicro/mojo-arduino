# modifications 
- added eeprom upload functionality so fpga can read 1024 non-volatile user programmable bytes upon startup.

This is the base code using by the Mojo V3 to load the FPGA and act as a USB to serial port/ADC for the FPGA. 

This code is intended to be used with a modified version of the Arduino IDE. It will not work "out of the box."

See https://alchitry.com/blogs/tutorials/arduino-ide for details.
